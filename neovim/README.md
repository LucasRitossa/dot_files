# Lucas's Dots
I have some of my dots in here, currently I only have nvim dots, might add more for WM and stuff at some point 

## Dependencies 
- NVIM (lua support)
- Vim Plug

## Building
Once dependencies are installed you must **PlugInstall**,**:CocInstall**, These install and build the dependencies, check git repos for vim-plugged stuff if something breaks :)
