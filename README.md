couple files to configure thing

   - vscodesettings.json is a vscode settings file, custom css/js files need set at the top (user specific)
   - shell customization file needs neofetch, typewritten, tmux, and a powerline font to function properly
   - custom CSS & JS VScode extension needs to be installed, and configured if you want extra customization
   - you can remove the [usupported] message at the top bar by installing the extension checksums, link below
